Linux-shell-assignment
PROJECT OVERVIEW This project helped us to learn more about linux and made us more familiar with us by using shell scripting programs and basic commands.

SCRIPT 1 This script takes a folder path from the user and creates a compressed .tar.gz backup file. It stores the backup in a dedicated backups folder inside the user's home directory. A timestamp is added to the backup filename so every backup is unique.

SCRIPT 2 This script reads the CPU usage, memory usage, and top processes consuming resources. It uses commands like top, free, and ps to show a quick system health summary.

SCRIPT 3 This script automates downloading files from the internet. The user provides a file URL, and the script downloads it into a downloads folder. The file gets a timestamped name to avoid overwriting. It uses wget for downloading.# CSFCP-ASSIGGNMENT
